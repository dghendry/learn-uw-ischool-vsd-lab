	abstract = {One of the most constant variables of today's management practices is the notion of change, adaptation, and innovation. Executives willingly embrace change when solutions can be found for and applied to particular problems. Losing sales? Improve product quality. Taking too long to get your product to the distributor? Shake up inventory. Threatened by a takeover? Make your management and corporation more lean, mean, and responsive to the shareholders. In a way, such change is easy because it doesn't challenge the assumptions of good managers. Faced with a problem, they simply apply yet another formulaic solution. In the end, such easy change won't work against the kind of economic upheaval that has occurred in the last 15 years. Some fundamental modifications have been made in the way we do business. Shouldn't the corporate response be equally fundamental? In the last issue of HBR, the author described how he and a group of strategic planners at Royal Dutch/Shell began to put in place a most innovative way to prepare managers to think more clearly about the future–scenario analysis. What was required was not the application of a new formula for planning but rather a new way of thinking. To show how difficult the transformation, the author described how the company came up with the idea and developed it in the early 1970s. In this sequel, he carries the story forward to describe the medium-term scenarios constructed in 1975. At a time when management's attention suddenly became fixed on the next quarter as opposed to the next decade, effective medium-term analysis proved vital in translating scenario theory into practice. The author patiently walks the reader through the development of the 1975 scenarios and then discusses the implications of scenario analysis on the practice of management.},

	abstract = {It is fashionable to downplay and even denigrate the usefulness of economic forecasting. The reason is obvious: forecasters seem to be more often wrong than right. Yet most U.S. companies continue to use a variety of forecasting techniques because no one has apparently developed a better way to deal with the future's economic uncertainty. Still, there are exceptions, like Royal Dutch/Shell. Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Shell developed a technique known as "scenario planning." By listening to planners' analysis of the global business environment, Shell's management was prepared for the eventuality–if not the timing–of the 1973 oil crisis. And again in 1981, when other oil companies stockpiled reserves in the aftermath of the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, Shell sold off its excess before the glut became a reality and prices collapsed. Undoubtedly, many readers believe they are familiar with scenarios. But the decision scenarios developed by Shell in Europe are a far cry from their usual U.S. counterparts. In this article and a sequel to come, the author describes their evolution and ultimate impact on Shell's management.},

Common to the examples are the use of scenarios to support the tensions between reflection and action, between typical and critical situations, and between plus and minus situations. The paper illustrates how a variety of more specific scenarios emphasising, e.g. critical situations, or even caricatures of situations are very useful for helping groups of users and designers being creative in design. Emphasising creativity in design is a very different view on the design process than normally represented in usability work or software/requirement engineering, where generalising users’ actions are much more important than, in this paper, the suggested richness of and contradiction between actual use situations. In general the paper proposes to attune scenarios to the particular purposes of the situations they are to be used in, and to be very selective based on these purposes.},

It is argued that rules are derived from underlying types - functional building types, references, spatial gestalts and experiential archetypes - that serve as ‘holding environments’ for design knowledge.},

A process of aggregation leads from local practices of designing participatory procedures like the citizens jury, planning cell, or consensus conference in the 1970s and 1980s, to the disembedding and proliferation of procedural formats in the 1990s, and into the trans-local consolidation of participatory practices through laboratory-based expertise since about 2000. Our account highlights a central irony: anti-technocratic engagements with governance gave birth to efforts at establishing technoscientific control over questions of political procedure. But such efforts have been met with various forms of reflexive engagement that draw out implications and turn design questions back into matters of concern. An emerging informal assessment regime for technologies of participation as yet prevents closure on one dominant global design for democracy beyond the state.},

The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

In this article, we argue that experiences and interactions with the arts should play an important role in the education of a specific group of technical workers—information professionals—and that such interactions provide a useful and necessary complement to the more familiar rational, scientific model that currently informs technical professional education. We discuss the principles inherent in an arts-based approach to learning and show how the work done by information professionals is similar to the work done by creative and performing artists as well as those in the design professions. Finally, we describe three examples of complementary learning opportunities built on arts-based practices.},

A framework to explain the nature of systems development as a research methodology in IS research is proposed. Use of this methodology in the engineering field in general is compared with its use specifically in computer science and computer engineering. An integrated program for conducting IS research that incorporates theory building, systems development, experimentation, and observation is proposed. Progress in several application domains is reviewed to provide a basis upon which to argue that systems development is a valid research methodology. A systems development research process is presented from a methodological perspective. Software engineering, which is the basic method of applying the systems development research methodology, is then discussed. It is the authors' belief that systems development and other research methodologies are complementary and that an integrated multi-dimensional and multimethodological approach will generate fruitful IS research results. The premise is that research contributions can result from systems development, experimentation, observation, and performance testing of the systems under development and that all of these research approaches are needed to investigate different aspects of the research question.},

	abstract = {This exploratory article reviews literature on design activism and looks into the ways, how design can be used to bring matters to a head in our society. Sustainable design can be perceived as design activism [Fuad-Luke, 2009], as it involves tackling with policies and behaviors, and pursuing of societal benefit. Literature suggests that design activism can be perceived as design exploration [Fuad-Luke, 2009], seeking to provoke, criticize and experiment [Fallman, 2008]. This text studies explorative and participatory design approach in the context of sustainable consumption. Focus of this article is on a participatory web campaign called Apocalypse Faster! that takes an anti-activist stand against consumerism. Furthermore, the participatory approach taken in the case suggests that in the context of sustainability - which is a contested concept - the design explorations should be made more open to public participation, to\&nbsp;better\&nbsp;enable societal discourse around the topics at hand. Later on this emphasis could reveal new perspectives for sustainable design. \&nbsp; References: 1. Fallman, D., 2008.
